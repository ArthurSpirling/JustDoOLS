# Why Simple Models Almost Always Work Best: A Non-Technical Explainer

Our paper has some technical elements, though the underlying ideas are straightforward. Here we give a non-technical account of our claims and our evidence for those claims.  The intended audience is one of social scientists who are potentially unfamiliar with recent developments in machine learning---especially ``deep learning". Below each section you will find a ``too long, didn't read" summary. 

## 1. Machine Learning in Political Science?

Suppose you wanted to predict conflict between nations, or the winner of an election, or the outcomes for children in the state social welfare system.  How would you do it?  First, to clarify the problem, let's be clear about what we mean by *predict*.
