# Why Simple Models Almost Always Work Best: A Non-Technical Explainer

Our paper has some technical elements, though the underlying ideas are straightforward. Here we give a non-technical account of our claims and our evidence for those claims.  The intended audience is one of social scientists who are potentially unfamiliar with recent developments in machine learning---especially ``deep learning". Below each section you will find a ``too long, didn't read" summary. 

## 1. Machine Learning in Political Science

Suppose you wanted to predict conflict between nations, or the winner of a general election, or the outcomes for children in the state social welfare system.  How would you do it?  First, let's be clear about what we mean by *predict*.  What we care about is good *forecasts*: you give me a bunch of conditions---values of variables (the *X*s)---and I tell you what will happen to the outcome (*Y*).  For instance, you tell me the state of the economy (*X1*), how popular the candidates are (*X2*), whether there are incumbents running (*X3*) and so on...and I tell you who will win (*Y*). Importantly, we are not trying to *explain* how candidates win votes with some theoretical model of the world which we then take to data.  We are just trying to do the best job we can---the most *accurate* job we can---of saying what will happen. So, for example, we don't think that one poll has a causal effect on another poll a month later.  But that earlier poll is probably *informative* about what will happen in that later poll and then in the election itself.

But to return to the task: what methods would we used to produce the prediction?  The answer over the past 50 years or so has been *machine learning*.  Exactly what we mean by ``machine learning" depends on the field and the problem, but the basic idea is to *automate* some of the model-building and model-fitting we would otherwise do by hand.  To be more specific, we are interested here in *supervised learning*.
